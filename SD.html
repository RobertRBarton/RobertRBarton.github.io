			For my Senior Design class me and my team were asked to build a secure testing head mounted display. Our device will generally look and function like a VR headset but with much more restriced features.
			This headset will allow students to take a multiple choice tests in a secure, comfortable, and distractionless enviorment. We hope that after some deveploment beyond our inital prototype this device will give
			proctors peace of mind not only from essentially using a lockdown browser but also a known secure device. In the future we hope to also and sensors to further aid in maintiainig test security.

			I am the Team lead on this project so I do a lot of administrative work, agendas and such. I'm also writing all the user facing software. When our device boots up it needs to check whether it can connect to 
			the internet. If it can connect it sends the user to their test. If it cannot it asks the user for netwrok information so it can connect to the internet and then sends the user to the test. 
			I've written all of that code including the page that users input thier infor into. 
			<br><br>
			At the time of writing this (3/19/21) this project is ongoing. However we've been doing good so far and I feel rather confident we will deliver the core of the product by the end of this semester.
