			The class that taught me HTML, CSS, and JS culminated in a team project at the end of the semester. I worked with four of my class mates to create the "Game Zone" a website hosted on a provided server that
			had Tic-Tac-Toe, chess, and we had planned to include checkers but sadly ran out of time. We did include multiplayer and single player against an AI.
			<br><br>
			I was the frontend lead on the project meaning I wrote or at least signed off on all of the code that would be on users device when they were on the game zone. We took an intresting design path 
			but I amde sure all the JS and frontend to backend communication worked like a charm.
			<br><br>
			As I mentioned we were unfortunetly unable to get checkers working but I think the technically demanding elements like screen transitions and multiplayer support were rock solid. I enjoyed working on the
			game zone and used it as a framework on this site.
