			For my senior portfolio class I was required to create a website with several specific things included. Instead of using a template service like wix, which I feel is rather canned, I wrote the entire website myself.
			This did backfire slightly as I planned to work on and off over the course of the semester but was then informed part way throught the semester that I had misread the assignmentan it was due in a week.
			That said, I had a lot of fun customizing my own website and designing everything the way I wanted.
			<br><br>
			I wrote this entire site. It's made of HTML, CSS and JS and hosted by GitHub. There were some hang ups like the dropdown menu not looking how I wanted and CSS's aspect ratio option taking far to long to find.
			You, dear user, are the final judge of how this website turned out. I think it worked out pretty well. I have some cleaning up to do behind the scenes but it looks and works the way I want it to.
