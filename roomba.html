			My embeded systems class had a lab compenent that revolved around a semester long project to make a modified roomba vacum navigate a random obstacle course. We were charged with taking the raw data from sensors,
			processing it, and telling the robot how to move.
			<br><br>
			I was the team lead on this project and mostly focusedo n integration of other team members code. I also wrote all the ending code. Our robot upon detecting the end goal would approach it and then send a communication
			back to the computer and play a little song.
			<br><br>
			This project was a lot of fun to work on and watch play out. We got a really good grade from all the extra bells and whistle we were able to tack onto our project and I made a good friend.
