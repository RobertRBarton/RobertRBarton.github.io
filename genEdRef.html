<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:139.05px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">HDFS 239: Consumer issues, and LDST 322: Leadership in a diverse environment.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:170.79px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">History 390 was a very interesting course. We covered most major wars in Europe and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:202.53px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">evolve and adapt to different pressures. For example, after Napoleon conquered most of western Europe in the name of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:218.40px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">France, he attempted to economically align himself with his neighbors. France at this time was spread thin and facing a lot</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:250.13px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">meter of the coast was impossible so Napolean was forced to fight an economic blockade war. This was partially due to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:266.00px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">the British specializing in naval warfare most of their history. Britain was always on the cutting edge of naval warfare</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:281.87px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">because if they weren’t they would be conquered swiftly. This logistical thread can be seen throughout history. World War</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:313.61px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">tank for the Americans. America needed a than that could be loaded on flatcars in the middle of the country, transported</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:345.35px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">like Germany simply needed to drive their tanks a few towns over before reaching the front lines. Well-planned operational</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:361.21px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">logistics always increase the chance a plan will succeed even if they end up being useless. Engineers need to keep in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:377.08px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">mind that preparation and requirement identification is vital to any engineering job. A tank is no good if you can’t get it into</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:456.43px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">HDFS 239 was an interesting class. It really drove home just how important budgeting is regardless of how much money.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:472.29px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">We went in-depth with how living below your means is the easiest way to gain and maintain wealth, advice I intend to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:504.03px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">are thus the best financial advisors out there. Budgeting is also necessary for engineering where you’ll be often asked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:519.90px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">how much a project is going to cost and then held to that. I think consumer issues better apply to the general public,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:596.47px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">relationships during a project over goals and how either focus can be useful in certain situations. We’ve talked about how emotional</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:654.66px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threatened and/or silenced before they could unify the African American community. This class will certainly help in engineering</span></div>
